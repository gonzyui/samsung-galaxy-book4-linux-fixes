# Samsung Galaxy Book4 Linux Fixes

Fixes for hardware that doesn't work out of the box on Linux (Ubuntu 24.04+) on Samsung Galaxy Book4 laptops. Tested on the **Galaxy Book4 Ultra** — should also work on Pro, Pro 360, and Book5 models with the same hardware, but only the Ultra has been directly verified.

> **Disclaimer:** These fixes involve loading kernel modules and running scripts with root privileges. While they are designed to be safe and reversible (both include uninstall steps), they are provided **as-is with no warranty**. Modifying kernel modules carries inherent risk — in rare cases, incompatible drivers could cause boot issues or system instability. **Use at your own risk.** It is recommended to have a recent backup and know how to access recovery mode before proceeding.

## Quick Install

Each fix can be downloaded and installed in a single command — no git required.

### Speaker Fix (no sound from built-in speakers)

> **Microphone warning:** This fix uses the legacy HDA audio driver, which does not support the built-in digital microphones (DMIC). On some models (e.g., Galaxy Book5 Pro 360 on Lunar Lake), the DMIC may already work under the default SOF driver — installing this speaker fix will disable it. If your internal mic currently works, you will lose it. See [Microphone Status](#microphone-status) for details.

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/Andycodeman/samsung-galaxy-book4-linux-fixes/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz | tar xz && cd samsung-galaxy-book4-linux-fixes-main/speaker-fix && sudo ./install.sh && sudo reboot
```

To uninstall: `sudo ./uninstall.sh && sudo reboot`

### Webcam Fix (built-in camera not detected)

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/Andycodeman/samsung-galaxy-book4-linux-fixes/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz | tar xz && cd samsung-galaxy-book4-linux-fixes-main/webcam-fix && ./install.sh && sudo reboot
```

To uninstall: `./uninstall.sh && sudo reboot`

The webcam works with **Firefox, Chromium, Zoom, Teams, OBS, mpv, VLC**, and most other apps. See [webcam known app issues](webcam-fix/README.md#known-app-issues) for Cheese and GNOME Camera compatibility.

## What's Included

### [Speaker Fix](speaker-fix/) — MAX98390 HDA Driver (DKMS) — Output Only

The internal speakers use 4x Maxim MAX98390 I2C amplifiers that have no kernel driver yet. This DKMS package provides the missing driver, based on [thesofproject/linux PR #5616](https://github.com/thesofproject/linux/pull/5616). **Note:** This fix addresses speaker output only — it does not enable the built-in microphones (see [Microphone Status](#microphone-status) below).

- Builds two kernel modules via DKMS (auto-rebuilds on kernel updates)
- Creates I2C devices for the amplifiers on boot
- Loads DSM firmware with separate woofer/tweeter configurations
- Auto-detects and removes itself when native kernel support lands

> **Battery Impact:** This workaround keeps the speaker amps always-on, using ~0.3–0.5W extra (~3–5% battery life). This goes away automatically when native kernel support lands.

> **Secure Boot:** Most laptops have Secure Boot enabled. If you've never installed a DKMS/out-of-tree kernel module before, you'll need to do a **one-time MOK key enrollment** (reboot + blue screen + password) before the modules will load. See the [full walkthrough](speaker-fix/README.md#secure-boot-setup).

### [Webcam Fix](webcam-fix/) — Intel IPU6 / OV02C10

The built-in webcam uses Intel IPU6 (Meteor Lake) with an OmniVision OV02C10 sensor. Five separate issues prevent it from working reliably: IVSC modules don't auto-load, IVSC/sensor boot race condition causing intermittent black frames, missing camera HAL, v4l2loopback name mismatch, and PipeWire device misclassification. The fix includes adding IVSC modules to the initramfs (eliminating the boot race) and hardening the relay service with auto-restart.

## Microphone Status

The Galaxy Book4/5 laptops have built-in dual array digital microphones (DMIC). Whether they work on Linux **depends on your model and audio driver**:

| Model | Platform | Default Driver | Mic (without speaker fix) | Mic (with speaker fix) |
|-------|----------|---------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Book4 Ultra | Meteor Lake | Legacy HDA | No | No |
| Book4 Pro / Pro 360 | Meteor Lake | Legacy HDA | Unknown | No |
| Book5 Pro 360 | Lunar Lake | SOF | **Yes** | **No — speaker fix disables it** |
| Book5 Pro 14" | Lunar Lake | SOF | Varies by report | No |

**Why the speaker fix affects the mic:** The speaker fix uses the legacy `snd_hda_intel` audio driver, which only exposes the Realtek ALC298 analog codec. The built-in DMIC requires the SOF (Sound Open Firmware) DSP driver. On Lunar Lake models (Book5 series) where SOF is the default driver, the DMIC may already work — but installing this speaker fix switches to legacy HDA, which disables it.

**When will both work together?** The [SOF upstream PR #5616](https://github.com/thesofproject/linux/pull/5616) is building native SOF support for Galaxy Book4/5 that will handle both speakers and DMIC together. This is expected to land in **Linux kernel 7.0 (mid-April 2026)** or **7.1 (June 2026)**. Once that ships in your distro kernel, the speaker fix in this repo will auto-detect native support and remove itself, and the built-in microphones should work automatically.

**Workarounds for now:**
- Use a **USB headset or microphone** — works immediately, no configuration needed
- Use the **3.5mm headphone/mic combo jack** — the external mic input (ALC298 Node 0x18) is functional

## Tested On

- **Samsung Galaxy Book4 Ultra** — Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, Kernel 6.17.0-14-generic (HWE)

The upstream speaker PR (#5616) was also confirmed working on Galaxy Book4 Pro, Pro 360, and Book4 Pro 16-inch by other users, so this fix should work on those models too — but it has only been directly tested on the Ultra. If you try it on another model, please report back.

## Hardware

| Component | Details |
|---|---|

| Speaker Amps | 4x MAX98390 on I2C (`0x38`, `0x39`, `0x3c`, `0x3d`) |
| Camera ISP | Intel IPU6 Meteor Lake (`8086:7d19`) |
| Camera Sensor | OmniVision OV02C10 (`OVTI02C1`) |
| Microphones | Dual array DMIC (digital — status varies by model, see [Microphone Status](#microphone-status)) |
