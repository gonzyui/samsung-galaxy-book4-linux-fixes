# Tuning file for OmniVision OV02E10 on Intel IPU7 (Lunar Lake)
# Used by libcamera's Simple pipeline handler / Software ISP
#
# The default uncalibrated.yaml has no CCM (color correction matrix),
# which produces a near-grayscale image. The OV02E10 sensor has a
# red+blue bias that causes a purple tint with symmetric CCMs, so
# this file boosts green more than R/B to compensate.
#
# This is NOT a proper sensor calibration — use tune-ccm.sh to
# interactively find the best preset for your lighting conditions.
# Proper per-sensor tuning files are being developed upstream by
# the libcamera project.
#
# To adjust manually: edit values below, keeping each row summing
# to 1.0 (preserves neutral greys). Restart PipeWire after changes:
#   systemctl --user restart pipewire wireplumber
