# Tuning file for OmniVision OV02E10 on Intel IPU7 (Lunar Lake)
# Used by libcamera's Simple pipeline handler / Software ISP
#
# The default uncalibrated.yaml has no CCM (color correction matrix),
# which produces a near-grayscale or green-tinted image. This file
# adds a light CCM that restores reasonable color. It's not a full
# sensor calibration — proper tuning files are expected upstream.
