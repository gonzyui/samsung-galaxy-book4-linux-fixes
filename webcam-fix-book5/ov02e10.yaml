# Tuning file for OmniVision OV02E10 on Intel IPU7 (Lunar Lake)
# Used by libcamera's Simple pipeline handler / Software ISP
#
# The default uncalibrated.yaml has no CCM (color correction matrix),
# which produces a near-grayscale image. This file adds a symmetric
# saturation-boost CCM that restores color without introducing hue bias.
# Each row sums to 1.0 (preserves neutral greys).
#
# This is NOT a proper sensor calibration — it uniformly boosts color
# saturation. Proper per-sensor tuning files with Macbeth chart
# calibration are being developed upstream by the libcamera project.
#
# To adjust: increase diagonal values (e.g. 1.3) and decrease
# off-diagonals (e.g. -0.15) proportionally. Rows must sum to 1.0.
