# Tuning file for OmniVision OV02E10 on Intel IPU7 (Lunar Lake)
# Used by libcamera's Simple pipeline handler / Software ISP
#
# Samsung Galaxy Book5 (940XHA/960XHA): the sensor is mounted upside-down
# but the mainline ov02e10 driver has a bug — it sets MODIFY_LAYOUT on flip
# controls but never updates the bayer format code. libcamera's Simple
# pipeline handler never calls bayerOrder() because the code doesn't change.
# Result: debayer uses SGRBG pattern on SGBRG data, swapping R and B channels.
#
# Fix: This CCM swaps R↔B columns to compensate, restoring correct colors.
# The matrix is the green-boost CCM with columns 1 and 3 exchanged.
# Use tune-ccm.sh to interactively find the best color preset.
