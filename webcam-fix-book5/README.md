# Fix: Samsung Galaxy Book5 Webcam on Arch / Fedora / Ubuntu (Intel IPU7 / OV02C10 / Lunar Lake)

> **!! EXPERIMENTAL — UNTESTED ON SAMSUNG HARDWARE — USE AT YOUR OWN RISK !!**
>
> This fix has **NOT been tested on any Samsung Galaxy Book5 model**. It is based on research from working setups on other Lunar Lake laptops (Dell XPS 13 9350, Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen13) and one unverified Book5 360 report on Fedora 42. **It may not work, may require manual adjustments, or could potentially cause system instability.** If you try it, please report your results so we can improve it.

**Status:** Experimental / Community testing
**Supported distros:** Arch-based (CachyOS, Manjaro, EndeavourOS), Fedora 42+, and Ubuntu (with libcamera 0.6+ built from source)
**Hardware:** Intel IPU7 (Lunar Lake, PCI ID `8086:645d` or `8086:6457`), OV02C10 (`OVTI02C1`) or OV02E10 (`OVTI02E1`) sensor

---

## What This Fixes

The Samsung Galaxy Book5 (Lunar Lake) webcam doesn't work on Linux because:

1. **Missing `intel_cvs` kernel module** — The Intel Computer Vision Subsystem (CVS) module is required to power the camera sensor on IPU7, but it's not yet in the mainline kernel. Intel provides it via DKMS from their [vision-drivers](https://github.com/intel/vision-drivers) repo.
2. **LJCA modules don't auto-load** — The Lunar Lake Joint Controller for Accessories (`usb_ljca`, `gpio_ljca`) provides GPIO/USB control needed by the vision subsystem. These must load before `intel_cvs` and the sensor, but aren't auto-loaded on all systems.
3. **Missing userspace pipeline** — IPU7 uses libcamera (not the IPU6 camera HAL). The `pipewire-libcamera` plugin connects libcamera to PipeWire so apps can access the camera.
This installer packages all of those pieces into a single script.

---

## How It Works

The IPU7 camera pipeline is simpler than IPU6 — no v4l2loopback or relay service needed:

```
usb_ljca + gpio_ljca  →  intel_cvs (DKMS)  →  OV02C10/OV02E10  →  libcamera  →  PipeWire  →  Apps
(LJCA GPIO/USB)           (powers sensor)      (kernel sensor)      (userspace)   (pipewire-    (Firefox,
                                                                                   libcamera)    Zoom, etc.)
```

**Key difference from Book4 (IPU6) fix:** The Book4 fix uses Intel's proprietary camera HAL (`icamerasrc`) with a v4l2loopback relay. The Book5 fix uses the open-source libcamera stack, which talks directly to PipeWire — no relay, no loopback, no initramfs changes needed.

## Supported Distros

| Distro | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Arch / CachyOS / Manjaro** | Supported | libcamera 0.6+ in repos |
| **Fedora 42+** | Supported | libcamera 0.6+ in repos |
| **Ubuntu** | Supported (with manual steps) | Requires libcamera 0.6+ built from source and kernel 6.18+ compiled manually. See [Ubuntu instructions](#ubuntu-specific-setup) below. |

---

## Requirements

- **Kernel 6.18+** — IPU7, USBIO, and OV02C10 drivers are all in-tree starting from 6.18
- **Lunar Lake hardware** — Intel IPU7 (PCI ID `8086:645d` or `8086:6457`)
- **libcamera 0.6+** — Available in Arch/Fedora repos; must be built from source on Ubuntu
- **Internet connection** — To download the intel_cvs DKMS module from GitHub

---

## Ubuntu-Specific Setup

Ubuntu 24.04 ships kernel 6.17 and libcamera 0.2.x — both too old for IPU7. To use this fix on Ubuntu, you need to manually provide:

1. **Kernel 6.18+** — Compile from source or install a [mainline kernel build](https://kernel.ubuntu.com/mainline/). One user confirmed kernel 6.19.2 works.
2. **libcamera 0.6+** — Build from source following the [libcamera getting started guide](https://libcamera.org/getting-started.html). Ubuntu's apt packages are too old.

The installer will detect Ubuntu and **check your libcamera version** at runtime. If libcamera 0.6+ is found (however you installed it), the script will proceed — it skips the package install step and only sets up the DKMS module and configuration files.

**Reference:** The [Arch Wiki Dell XPS 13 9350 camera page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dell_XPS_13_(9350)_2024#Camera) has a detailed walkthrough for the same hardware. The steps can be adapted for Ubuntu.

## Quick Install

**No git?** Download, install, and reboot in one step:

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/Andycodeman/samsung-galaxy-book4-linux-fixes/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz | tar xz && cd samsung-galaxy-book4-linux-fixes-main/webcam-fix-book5 && ./install.sh && sudo reboot
```

**Already cloned?**

```bash
./install.sh
sudo reboot
```

**Skip hardware check** (for testing on non-Lunar Lake systems):

```bash
./install.sh --force
```

---

## Uninstall

```bash
./uninstall.sh
sudo reboot
```

The uninstaller removes the DKMS module, source files, and all configuration files. It does **not** remove distro packages (libcamera, etc.) since you may need them for other purposes.

---

## Known Issues

### Desaturated / grayscale / green-tinted image

libcamera's Software ISP uses `uncalibrated.yaml` by default, which has **no color correction matrix (CCM)** — producing near-grayscale or green-tinted images. The installer now installs a sensor-specific tuning file (`ov02e10.yaml` or `ov02c10.yaml`) with a light CCM that restores reasonable color.

If your image still looks desaturated after installing, verify the tuning file is in place:
```bash
ls /usr/share/libcamera/ipa/simple/ov02*.yaml /usr/local/share/libcamera/ipa/simple/ov02*.yaml 2>/dev/null
```

**Note:** The included CCM is a "light touch" correction — image quality won't match Windows, which uses Intel's proprietary ISP tuning. Full sensor calibration files are [being developed upstream](https://patchwork.libcamera.org/cover/22762/) by the libcamera project.

### Vertically flipped image

Some Samsung Galaxy Book5 models (940XHA, 960XHA) have the OV02E10 sensor mounted upside-down, but Samsung's BIOS incorrectly reports `camera_sensor_rotation=0`. The installer now includes a **DKMS patched `ipu-bridge.ko`** that adds Samsung DMI quirk entries to the kernel's upside-down sensor table, so libcamera sets the correct flip controls automatically.

**This fix is installed automatically** on affected Samsung models (940XHA, 960XHA). It will **auto-remove itself** when a future kernel includes the Samsung entries upstream. On non-Samsung systems, this step is skipped.

If you still see a flipped image on a different model, the rotation metadata for that platform may be incorrect or missing.

### Browsers / apps don't see the camera (Ubuntu source builds)

On Ubuntu, if you built PipeWire and libcamera from source (installed to `/usr/local`), PipeWire may not find the libcamera SPA plugin. The installer auto-detects this and sets `SPA_PLUGIN_DIR` in `/etc/environment.d/libcamera-ipa.conf`. **A reboot is required** for PipeWire's systemd user service to pick up the new environment variable.

If apps still don't see the camera after reboot, verify PipeWire found the plugin:
```bash
wpctl status | grep -A 15 "Video"
# Should show a libcamera device, not just v4l2 entries
```

### Firefox / browser conflicts with qcam

One user reported that opening the camera in Firefox kills the image in qcam, requiring a reboot to recover. This appears to be a resource contention issue between PipeWire and direct libcamera access. Avoid running qcam and browser-based camera access simultaneously.

### Browser doesn't show camera / no permission prompt

Browsers require explicit PipeWire camera support to be enabled:

**Firefox:** Navigate to `about:config` and set:
```
media.webrtc.camera.allow-pipewire = true
```

**Chrome / Chromium:** Navigate to `chrome://flags` and enable:
```
#enable-webrtc-pipewire-camera
```
Then relaunch the browser. If Chrome still shows "waiting for your permission" without a prompt, try:
1. Go to `chrome://settings/content/camera` and ensure the correct camera is selected
2. Clear site permissions for the page you're testing
3. Try an Incognito window (to rule out extension conflicts)

**Note:** These flags may become enabled by default in future browser versions.

### PipeWire doesn't see the camera

If the camera works with `cam -l` but PipeWire apps don't see it:

```bash
systemctl --user restart pipewire wireplumber
```

If that doesn't help, verify that `pipewire-libcamera` (Arch) or `pipewire-plugin-libcamera` (Fedora) is installed. On Ubuntu, you may need to build the PipeWire libcamera SPA plugin from source.

## Configuration Files

The install script creates these files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/etc/modules-load.d/intel-ipu7-camera.conf` | Load LJCA + intel_cvs modules at boot |
| `/etc/modprobe.d/intel-ipu7-camera.conf` | Softdep: LJCA -> intel_cvs -> sensor load order |
| `/etc/wireplumber/wireplumber.conf.d/50-disable-ipu7-v4l2.conf` | Hide raw IPU7 V4L2 nodes from PipeWire (WirePlumber 0.5+) |
| `/etc/wireplumber/main.lua.d/51-disable-ipu7-v4l2.lua` | Hide raw IPU7 V4L2 nodes from PipeWire (WirePlumber 0.4) |
| `/usr/share/libcamera/ipa/simple/ov02e10.yaml` | Sensor color tuning file with CCM (OV02E10) |
| `/usr/share/libcamera/ipa/simple/ov02c10.yaml` | Sensor color tuning file with CCM (OV02C10) |
| `/etc/environment.d/libcamera-ipa.conf` | Set LIBCAMERA_IPA_MODULE_PATH + SPA_PLUGIN_DIR (systemd sessions) |
| `/etc/profile.d/libcamera-ipa.sh` | Set LIBCAMERA_IPA_MODULE_PATH + SPA_PLUGIN_DIR (login shells) |
| `/usr/src/vision-driver-1.0.0/` | DKMS source for intel_cvs module |
| `/usr/src/ipu-bridge-fix-1.0/` | DKMS source for patched ipu-bridge (Samsung 940XHA/960XHA only) |
| `/usr/local/sbin/ipu-bridge-check-upstream.sh` | Auto-removes ipu-bridge DKMS when upstream kernel has the fix |
| `/etc/systemd/system/ipu-bridge-check-upstream.service` | Runs upstream check on boot |

The ipu-bridge-fix files are only installed on Samsung 940XHA/960XHA models and auto-remove when the kernel includes the Samsung rotation entries. All files are removed by `uninstall.sh`.

## Troubleshooting

### `cam -l` shows no cameras

1. Verify LJCA modules are loaded: `lsmod | grep ljca`
2. Verify intel_cvs is loaded: `lsmod | grep intel_cvs`
3. Check kernel messages: `journalctl -b -k | grep -i "cvs\|ov02c10\|ov02e10\|ljca\|ipu"`
4. Verify IPU7 hardware: `lspci -d 8086:645d` or `lspci -d 8086:6457`
5. Try loading manually in order: `sudo modprobe usb_ljca && sudo modprobe gpio_ljca && sudo modprobe intel_cvs`
6. Try rebooting — some module loading sequences only work on fresh boot

### DKMS build fails

- Ensure kernel headers are installed:
  - Arch: `sudo pacman -S linux-headers`
  - Fedora: `sudo dnf install kernel-devel`
  - Ubuntu: `sudo apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r)`
- Check DKMS build log: `cat /var/lib/dkms/vision-driver/1.0.0/build/make.log`

### Secure Boot: module not loading

If Secure Boot is enabled, the DKMS module must be signed. On Fedora, the installer handles this with the akmods MOK key. You may need to:

1. Enroll the MOK key: `sudo mokutil --import /etc/pki/akmods/certs/public_key.der`
2. Reboot and complete the enrollment at the blue MOK Manager screen

If modules still won't load after enrollment, verify DKMS knows where your signing keys are:

```bash
cat /etc/dkms/framework.conf /etc/dkms/framework.conf.d/*.conf 2>/dev/null | grep mok_
```

If no `mok_signing_key` / `mok_certificate` lines appear, create a drop-in config (see [speaker-fix troubleshooting](../speaker-fix/README.md#troubleshooting) for details).

On Arch with Secure Boot, you'll need to sign the module manually or use a tool like `sbsigntools`.

### Galaxy Book4 Webcam Fix

If you have a **Galaxy Book4** (Meteor Lake / IPU6), you need the **[webcam-fix](../webcam-fix/)** directory instead. That fix uses a completely different pipeline (Intel camera HAL + v4l2loopback relay) and only supports Ubuntu.
